        <p> Dear Hiring Manager,
            <br>
            <br>
            I am writing to express my interest in a Software Engineer position within your organization.
             With a strong background in HVAC systems and diagnostics, combined with my growing skills in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, 
             I am eager to transition into the tech industry and contribute to a forward-thinking team. 
             Over the years, I've honed my ability to solve complex problems, lead teams effectively, and communicate clearly in both English and Spanish. 
             These strengths have not only allowed me to excel in my current field, but also lay a strong foundation for success in software engineering. 
             My technical certifications, including the EPA and IC3, reflect my commitment to continual learning and professional development.
            I am passionate about technology and excited about the opportunity to build meaningful solutions through code. 
            I believe my unique blend of hands-on technical experience, leadership, and communication skills make me a strong candidate for an entry-level software engineering role. 
            I am confident that I can quickly adapt, contribute, and grow in a dynamic tech environment.
            Thank you for considering my application. 
            I would love the opportinity to speak further and demonstrate how my background and enthusiasm for software development can be a valuable asset to your team.
            <br>
            <br>Sincerely,
